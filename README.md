# go_bdp

To get started:
Download Go: https://golang.org/dl/

Go Installation Instructions: https://golang.org/doc/install

For development I use Atom text editor (there is a package for Go-plus for autocomplete and other nice features)

The main function sets an environment variable KUBE pointing to the path of the local kubernetes installation (path of kubectl.sh), 
needs to be modified according to your local installation.
